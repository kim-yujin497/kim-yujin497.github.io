    <h2>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PRODUCT OWNERS ARE THE KEY FOR BUSINESS SUCCESS</h2>
    <p><h4>Scrum framework, a popular agile development method defines the role of a product owner as someone who is responsible for maximizing the value of the scrum team. The scrum framework depends on the role of a product owner, scrum master, and developer. By this, we understand that a product owner creates a product vision, communicates the vision with the stakeholders, and creates the product backlog.  The Scrum framework also dictates that a PO is required to have a business, user experience, technical and communication skills</h4></p>

    <h2>How AI can help prevent active shooters and save lives</h2>
    <p><h4>Many currently rely on technology like walk-through or handheld magnetometers, which detect changes in local magnetic fields. Video surveillance systems are increasingly deployed to address the challenges associated with firearm incidents, although monitoring can be difficult, unreliable and expensive. Newer technologies leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are necessary to keep pace with threats that have evolved beyond standard security measures.</h4></p>
