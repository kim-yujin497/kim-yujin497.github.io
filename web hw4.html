    There are two notable exceptions - China’s Chang'e 4, which achieved humanity's first soft landing on the far side of the Moon in 2019, and last year’s follow up, which both used the Queqiao Relay Satellite to pull off their feat. “But for our missions, right now, we don't have any relay capability,” Israel said.<p></p>

That's a problem if the US ever wants to explore the far side of the Moon, which never faces Earth. Even on the side that faces us, craters and valleys can block direct line of sight, while the need for every mission and every device to have its own direct-Earth connection capabilities can limit their scope and ambition.
It’s clear we need infrastructure to communicate with people and equipment on our nearest neighbor, because new missions are planned. After nearly five decades of neglect, the US plans to return to the Moon in a big way.<p></p>

The Artemis program will take the first woman and the next man to the Moon in 2024, if everything goes to plan, and the Biden administration doesn’t make any changes. By the end of the decade, NASA hopes to have set up sustainable operations on the planetary satellite, with an eye to a manned Moon Base.
